TinyWM is a ridiculously tiny window manager implemented in nearly as few lines
of Python as possible, without being obfuscated or entirely useless. It allows you
to move, resize, focus (sloppy), and raise windows -- that's it!  TinyWM's main
purpose is to serve as a quick example of some window manager programming
basics.

Files:

  Makefile: highly advanced build system
  tinywm.py: The Python code (requires CVS python-xlib due to a bug)

Usage:

  Focus follows pointer.
  Alt+Button1, drag: interactive window move
  Alt+Button3, drag: interactive window resize
  Ctrl-Alt-R: raise focused window
