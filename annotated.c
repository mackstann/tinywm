 * as possible, so having lots of comments just wasn't really fitting for it.
 * i want tinywm.c to be something you can just look at and go "wow, that's
 * it?  cool!"  so what i did was just copy it over to annotated.c and comment
 * the hell out of it.  ahh, but now i have to make every code change twice!
 * oh well.  i could always use some sort of script to process the comments out
 * of this and write it to tinywm.c ... nah.
